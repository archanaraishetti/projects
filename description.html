<p style="font-size:20px;"> Speech to text is software that works by listening to audio and delivering an editable, verbatim transcript on a given device. The software does this through voice recognition. A computer program draws on linguistic algorithms to sort auditory signals from spoken words and transfer those signals into text using characters called Unicode. Converting speech to text works through a complex machine learning model that involves several steps. Let's take a closer look at how this works:
<br>
    1.When sounds come out of someone's mouth to create words, it also makes a series of vibrations. Speech to text technology works by picking up on these vibrations and translating them into a digital language through an analog to digital converter.
  <br>  2.The analog-to-digital-converter takes sounds from an audio file, measures the waves in great detail, and filters them to distinguish the relevant sounds.
